# css-grid-min-content 

## Introduction  

I came across some code I want to turn into a card component.  
I takes advantage of the CSS min-content property.  
The author is using tables but I'm considering using the concept in dropdown menus and modals.

## Further Study  

I intend to learn more about intrinsic and extrinsic sizing 
in order to improve the responsiveness of my designs.
